# Dog generator survey

Responsive survey site with each question on its "own page"   built with react components, props and React hooks. Built with web accessibility in mind.

## The process
 My second project using React in the Technigo Bootcamp. I used a main component Form where I show diffrent question components depending on which question should be displayed furthermore all components is generating information using props and updating status using react hooks. I used the map method to iterate through the data to generate the activityLevel. 
 Dogs sugesstions and pictures where generated dependending on fur type type.
